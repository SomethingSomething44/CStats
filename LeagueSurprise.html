<h2 class="H2AboutUs"><center>Interesting stats so for for the MLG AW S1</center></h2>
            <p class="AboutUsID">This season has been interesting so far, and there has been some interesting stats on the leaderboards, here we will look at some of these stats that we would have not expected before the season<br>
Right now looking at Scump at number 1 KD with a 1.24 KD across 160 maps is not a surprise to a lot of people, he is a strong player who has been dominating the leaderboards since Black Ops 1 when he was on Quantic Gaming. However nobody expect Huke, a young player who has been dominating online and at LAN this game. Currently Huke is sitting at Number 2 overall KD, and he has a 1.19 KD across 89 maps. Huke has been impressive this season, and I'm sure a lot of teams and players are happy he is too young to attend the Cod Championships. <br>Another surprise entry in the top 5 has been Happy for Aware Gaming. after 161 maps happy has a 1.13 KD! Another young slayer who bursted on the scene this game. <br> <br> A surprise for the CTF captures leaderboard has been ricky. Now he is no longer the very slow turtle like anchor he was in Black Ops 2, but to see him at number 1 in CTF Captures is a big surprise. Currently he averages 1.69 caps a game after 36 maps. Overall he has a very impressive 61 caps. It is no surprise ricky has a 1.07 KD, but his objective work has been massive for Proph.<br> It is no surprise to see Nadeshot at number 2 averaging 1.44 caps a game after 34 maps, but to see his team mate Crimsix at number 5 is. After 28 maps Crimsix averages 1.25 captures a game, and has an overall cap of 35. It is no surprise to see. <br>Huke again has been a pleasant surprise on SND. Currently his SND KD of 1.32 after 30 maps has him top of the leaderboard, above players like scump, crimsix and saints. <br> <br>
When it comes to hosting, everybody knows that the player and team that has host will have a massive advantage over the team that is not host. However this has not been the case for Saints. While he has only hosted 10 maps he has a 1.12 KD on host. Very impressive, however when you see that he has a 1.13 KD off host with 138 maps played, it really is impressive. <br> <br>

It is no surprise to see Optic Gaming players with the kill records for HP, CTF and SND. Scump holds the kill record for HP with 57 kills on Detroit against Rise. Formal holds the record on CTF with 54 kills on Biolab against Proph. Crimsix has the SND kill record with 17 on Detroit against Faze. No surprise to see that Optic Gaming outslay the other team 82% of the time on Detroit SND.
