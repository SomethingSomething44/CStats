This repository is primarily used to host http://codcompstats.com. 
Be wary of opening the sheet0xx.html files in some of the folders as it tends to crash most browsers I've tested it on. It would be best to download them and view them locally.

Folder structure is a nightmare. EventName.html will have an assosiated folder with the same name, inside of this folder will be a collection of HTML, CSS, and JS files from when it was converted from Excel to WebPage. The original EventName.html isn't the index page for the event, instead it's just a blank html file that embeds all of the other files inside of the folder.

Due to where someone messed up, many files in the top level directory shouldn't be there.

The github is still hosting the old website, http://codcompstats.com/OLDindex.html. It's out dated, has some broken links, and generally shouldn't be used but we like to keep it up.
